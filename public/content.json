    "description": "WhatsApp is perhaps the only messaging app in the world that is free and does not display ads when you use it. When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, everybody thought WhatsApp would now start having ads. But it remained independent and had no ads. Even today, WhatsApp does not have any intrusive ads. It has a brilliant way of making money.

    "description": "In this episode of Investing in India, we explore India’s economic evolution through the lens of Akhilesh Tilotia, a former analyst at Kotak, government advisor, and now co-founder at Thurro. Initially approaching India’s transformation top-down, Tilotia highlighted broad structural shifts in The Making of India (2015), including issues like the “private cost of public failure,” where public infrastructure fails to deliver, leading to rising private costs. His subsequent government experience at the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund provided insight into the complex stakeholder dynamics behind policymaking. His second book, Through the Looking Glass (2021), reflects this more nuanced understanding, particularly the friction between expert advice and political representation in a democracy. Now, with Thurro, he uses bottom-up data to validate macroeconomic trends, especially tax base expansion and income growth. He shows India’s tax-to-GDP ratio is slowly improving, with more citizens entering the formal tax net.

In this episode, we chat with Alex Thomas, a renowned economics professor from Azim Premji University, about why Western economic theories don't always work in India. From inequality to real-world examples, we break down economics in a way that makes sense for Indians.

Why GDP growth numbers sparked controversy The myth of India’s massive middle class Why a 3% unemployment rate hides underemployment and informal work How 40% of working women earn no wages at all The real story behind urbanization, caste, and inequality Why phone access ≠ internet access (and what it means for digital India) How better data (and better questions) could change India's future And much more!
